Explore TAPICC from visualized overview

I don't undestand how basic cases interactions works in TAPICC, so I've decided to prepare a quick and visual way to overview all interactions needed for specific cases.

Mockup, which basic version will be ready on November 13, 2018: https://tapicc.terales.info/

Currently I have these cases on my TODO list:

1) Posting job from TMS into ProZ.com
2) Post project from TMS into QMS system (Protemos into TQAuditor)
3) Post job from TMS to TMS (case with different LSPs)
4) Post a job from TMS to SmartCAT
